## Summary
Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task.

##  Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
In this part I had to use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of my climate database. I completed a precipitation analysis and a station analysis. This can be found in the "SurfsUp" Folder.

## Design Your Climate App
In this part I designed a Flask API based on the queries that I just developed. This can be found in the "SurfsUp" Folder.
